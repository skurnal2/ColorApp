\f0\fs24 \cf0 The final project allowed me demonstrate almost all the concepts I have learnt In this course with main focus on Table View, Tab Bar, and Database Persistence with Core Data. The addition that I have made to the app includes a todo list that allows a user to enter A Todo List Item title and description and when the user saves that item, it takes it time stand (date) and saves that inside a database. For this I had to create an entity using core data. This application was the first time I had used data persistence with swift and I really liked the way it was done. Doing this was much easier than I had done it before. I really enjoyed working on this app, especially experimenting with different aspects of core data, and table view.}
