\f0\fs24 \cf0 This assignment motivated to go above and beyond what I have done till now. This time, I have used a tab bar and assigned the main pages their different icons, while some of them still being mapped using the segues. This allowed me to easily connect different view controllers between different screens. Another feature I have added is that I have made a new color picker using pickers this time, it doesn\'92t use an array instead it is a very simple logic, it takes in the RGB colors but this time they change the text color which is subsequently saved in app delegate which is accessible throughout the whole app. This also allowed me to make a dynamic app. On the next third tab, it retrieves the quotes from a URL that returns a JSON api. I have processed that json response and populated a table view using it. I, in future plan to make a new page that when a user chooses a quote uses the background color and color properties selected in previous pages to give a resultant quote on another page. I have also implemented a text to speech option on the \'93Background and Text\'94 page that speaks whatever the user has typed. The feature I am proud most about is the quotes retrieval functionality using Json API.}
