\f0\fs24 \cf0 This assignment allowed me to learn few very interesting features included with the iOS package. The first thing I learned was UserDefaults that how they allow users to store their app-specific settings and Settings bundle that allows user to manage those user defaults within the settings app. I found this feature very interesting as the values can be changed from within the app and also from the settings app and also reflect in vice-versa. This app is the continuation of my previous app Color App. This app allows user to store name, age and email preference in the user defaults and also allows to manage the same from within the settings app. One more feature that I have added is very handy for visually impaired people. It is text to speech. Once user clicks on it, they can know very easily what values they have entered and then proceed accordingly. This View Controller screen is also embedded inside the tab view to allow easy navigation.}
